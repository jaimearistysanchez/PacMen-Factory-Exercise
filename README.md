PacMen Factory Exercise

Description of Project

PacMen Factory Exercise consists in a screen with two buttons: one that creates a new PacMan, and one that animates them to start bouncing around the screen.

How to Run

The Project includes an html file, a javascript file, and images of PacMan with mouth opened and closed, looking left and right. The html file has the game buttons, while the javascript file has the functions required to both create the PacMen and make them move around the screen. 

Roadmap of future improvements

There are different improvements that could be done to this repository. There could be work done to have the PacMen created have different colors with the click of a third button that toggles between available colors. There can also be CSS work done on the screen, so that the buttons look nicer or the background of the screen isnâ€™t a blank page.
